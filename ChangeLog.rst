Changelog
=========


v0.1.0 (2022-11-23)
-------------------

New
~~~
- Add deb pkg and release workflows, update debian files. [Stephen L
  Arnold]
- Support timeout when receiving channel messages. [S. Lockwood-Childs]
- Pub-sub for notifications of settings changes. [S. Lockwood-Childs]

  Each component can receive notifications for changes to its own settings.
  These notifications are generated by the redis server
  https://redis.io/docs/manual/keyspace-notifications/
- Runtime config of redis-ipc itself. [S. Lockwood-Childs]

  Functions for configuring behavior of redis-ipc itself
  see RIPC_DEFAULT_* definitions for default values if not called

  // configure verbosity level for debug channel
  int redis_ipc_config_debug_verbosity(int verbosity);

  // configure whether debug messages will be shown on stderr
  int redis_ipc_config_stderr_debug(int enable_stderr);

  // configure which component will be authorized to write settings
  // (RIPC_COMPONENT_ANY works as wildcard for "any")
  int redis_ipc_config_settings_writer(const char *writer_component);
- Add dist target to tox cmds, update templates. [Stephen L Arnold]

  * templates: fix UK spellng, update verbiage
  * add dist target for release workflow

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Remove pull_request from conda-dev workflow (PR speed up) [Stephen L
  Arnold]
- Add or-true workaround for valgrind command_check. [Stephen L Arnold]

  * this makes it match the other valgrind checks
- Update test output files. [S. Lockwood-Childs]
- Update dependabot config. [Stephen L Arnold]

  * use custom prefix in commit msg
  * add label (if found)
  * no need to set target-branch for default

Fixes
~~~~~
- Workaround in env workflow, use the same gcovr config in ubuntus.
  [Stephen L Arnold]
- Bump workflow action versions, update to latest coverage.yml. [Stephen
  L Arnold]

  * cleanup github ci warning annotations
  * revert to upstream lcov_coberura_xml
- Fix "choke" action in github workflow. [S. Lockwood-Childs]

  if ctest is allowed to run before steps that run the tests
  under valgrind, the redis server started up in pre-commands
  will get shut down. Instead run tests via ctest using 'tests'
  target. Now "choke" action in github should pass.
- Cache global redis-ipc config in per-thread memory. [S. Lockwood-
  Childs]

  It's not efficient to be going out to the redis server to look up
  the current stderr-debug setting... load it once during thread init,
  and after that only if explicitly called

  Also started printing all 4 of the published messages in pub-sub test,
  instead of just the first couple.
- Clean up stderr debugging. [S. Lockwood-Childs]

  Added helper function stderr_debug() for the simple debug calls
  that check if debugging is enabled then do a single-line print.
  It adds a prefix ($COMPONENT) to the message, to make debugging
  flow easier to understand in multi-thread / multi-process apps.

  The debug messages that are printed piece-wise while iterating
  through a list are not handled by the new helper, so are mostly
  left alone, aside from adding prefix of component name to the
  message.
- Clean up lookup of stderr-debug config setting. [S. Lockwood-Childs]

  Improve strategy for preventing infinite recursion due to calling
  stderr_debug_is_enabled() in the process of looking up whether or not stderr
  debug is in fact enabled.

  Use a per-thread "force_quiet" flag to temporarily disable stderr debug
  during the lookup of the stderr-debug config setting, instead of trying to
  add "force_quiet" parameter to every function involved in looking up
  config settings (missed validate_redis_reply() before, and this is cleaner)

v0.0.4 (2021-11-04)
-------------------

New
~~~
- Add initial pre-commit config. [Stephen L Arnold]
- Add cmake module to generate coverage data. [Stephen L Arnold]

  * cmake module replicates makefile.am lcov/genhtml commands
  * tox bionic env updated to generate full coverage
  * move lcov to common deps in smoke workflow
  * note full coverage reqiures 2 passes, one with and one without
    the runtime socket path override (true for both autotools
    and cmake builds)
  * enabling cmake coverage also enables building test binaries;
    both are currently OFF by default

    - WITH_COVERAGE enables RIPC_BUILD_TESTING

- Update cmake to create and install pkgconfig file. [S. Lockwood-
  Childs]

  Note that library version is still being maintained in 2 places,
  both CMakeLists.txt and configure.ac -- would be good to move it to
  a separate version file that both can share, at some point.
- Update cmake to check for json-c with pkg-config. [S. Lockwood-Childs]

  Use consistent strategy for finding json-c and hiredis dependencies,
  which might be managed by pkg-config rather than native cmake modules

  Arnold]

  * leave option empty/define unset if not found
  * prefer path found in env over build option
  * pass ENV var in tox.ini
- Add section on tox commands, remove redis-ipc-py section. [Stephen L
  Arnold]
- Json_test coughs runtime exception on macos, disable for now. [Stephen

  Signed-off-by: Stephen L Arnold <nerdboy@gentoo.org>

  chg: dev: py38/39 is not resolving deps like 37, remove jinja py ver

  * this should really not be necessary, somehow devenv is inconsistent
  * it should work fine across all python versions 36 => 39
  * even on macos
- Cleanup ci cmds (per OS env), add python dep for conda devenv.
  [Stephen L Arnold]

  * bionic lcov is too old for required include usage

Other
~~~~~
- Disable macos include block in conda-dev workflow. [Stephen L Arnold]
- Update changelog for 0.0.4 release, revert macos ci test. [Stephen L
  Arnold]
- Update version in configure.ac, fix typo and check macos. [Stephen L
  Arnold]
- Json.hh: make cpplint happier. [S. Lockwood-Childs]
- Json.hh: throw custom exception for missing fields. [S. Lockwood-
  Childs]

  caller might want to specifically know about missing fields,
  so make that a specific exception that can be caught
- Json.hh: fix json constructor from json_object ptr. [S. Lockwood-
  Childs]

  * if ptr is null, create an empty object
  * if ptr is non-null, take a reference on it so it will not
    get freed until json wrapper object is done with it
- Fix package_version var for cmake and autotools. [Stephen L Arnold]
- Add cmake-format cfg file, apply formatting updates. [Stephen L
  Arnold]

  * this seems to keep more of the original format
  * although it does add more dangling close-parens
- Restore gcovr funtion report to coverage artifact. [Stephen L Arnold]
- Fix generated pkgconfig file. [S. Lockwood-Childs]

  Now the @prefix@ in redis-ipc.pc.in should get substituted when building
  with cmake (already worked for autotools builds)
- Update smoke/runtime workflows to use lcov from PPA on bionic.
  [Stephen L Arnold]
- Configurable path to redis server socket. [S. Lockwood-Childs]

  * compile-time configuration with RIPC_RUNTIME_DIR
    * with cmake
      cmake -DRIPC_RUNTIME_DIR=/var/tmp/redis-ipc
    * with automake
      export RIPC_RUNTIME_DIR=/var/tmp/redis-ipc ./configure

  In each case, default path will be $RIPC_RUNTIME_DIR/socket
  Note that matches the usage of RIPC_RUNTIME_DIR in scripts/run_redis.sh
  If you set RIPC_RUNTIME_DIR when building, use the same value
  when using run_redis.sh to setup for tests.

  Path can be overrident at runtime by setting RIPC_SERVER_PATH
  NOTE this is full path, not just the parent dir like RIPC_RUNTIME_DIR:
    export RIPC_SERVER_PATH=/var/tmp/redis-ipc/socket
- Allow building deb from git repo. [S. Lockwood-Childs]

  [Stephen L Arnold]


v0.0.2 (2021-07-23)
-------------------
- Switch build status badge to (internal) github actions. [Stephen L
  Arnold]
- Test alternate github license provider 2. [Stephen L Arnold]
- Update license (filename) to GPL-2.0 generated by github. [Stephen L
  Arnold]
- Add status badges to readme file (#4) [Steve Arnold]

  * add status badges to readme file
  * fix license file parsing (on github) and add SPDX id to primary sources

  Arnold]
- Add github CI and test across ubuntu/toolchain versions. [Stephen L
  Arnold]
- Ditch extraneous header file from python branch. [S. Lockwood-Childs]
- Some redis-py fixes in python module. [S. Lockwood-Childs]

  * redis.Connection is for tcp connections, not unix sockets,
    use redis.StrictRedis instead

  * blpop() returns None on timeout or (queue, value) if successful in
    popping value from queue
- Debug fix properly access globals. [nll]
- Deleted bogus comma. [nll]
- This is a version ready to be tested it is not checked out. [nll]
- Add server-side class to python module. [S. Lockwood-Childs]

  client-side class has one public method
    redis_ipc_send_and_receive()

  but server-side class has two
    redis_ipc_receive_command()
    redis_ipc_send_reply()

  because server has to do some processing between getting a command
  and sending back a reply
- C library encodes tid as integer, so match in python module. [S.
  Lockwood-Childs]
- Python module is really close to client-side functionality. [S.
  Lockwood-Childs]

  "client-side" means the code that generates commands and receives
  replies, as opposed to "server-side" code that waits for commands
  and services them.

  python now follows C-library conventions so it should (soon) interoperate
  with a server app written in C:

  * same mandatory fields for commands

    cmd["timestamp"]
    cmd["component"]
    cmd["thread"]
    cmd["tid"]
    cmd["results_queue"]
    cmd["command_id"]

  * same naming of queues for commands and their replies

    * command queue in format "queues.commands.$SERVER_COMPONENT"

    * reply queue in format "queues.results.$CLIENT_COMPONENT.$CLIENT_THREAD"

  TODO:

  Still need to fill in the actual redis connection bits,
  plus generate real timestamps for commands
- This version can do a few things it thinks it can send and receive
  messages, but it can not those functions are stubs the file can be
  imported into Python the code is written to raise exceptions, but none
  are handled yet no logging is performed. [nll]
- New version of skeleton and a tiny bit of meat. [nll]
- A little more client code for redis. [nll]
- A little more client code. [nll]
- Skeleton of redis client. [nll]
- A file was added proclaiming the vital features of the client library
  to implement in Python as a first phase no comment on what a new phase
  might bring. [nll]
- Redis_ipc.h: explicitly declare init/cleanup functions. [Steve Arnold]

  Fixes QA warnings about implicit declarations.


v0.0.1 (2017-03-11)
-------------------
- Make debian packaging straight from git work. [S. Lockwood-Childs]

  alternative is to do 'make dist' and use that as upstream tarball,
  either way should work...
- Fix date stamp in debian/copyright file. [Steve Arnold]
- Tweak debian/ubuntu packaging so it should work. [S. Lockwood-Childs]
- Add readme for example programs. [S. Lockwood-Childs]
- Add initial debian packaging files (still untested) [Steve Arnold]
- "tests" were more examples than tests, for now count running as
  "passed" [S. Lockwood-Childs]
- Cleanup cruft, need to test with running redis server. [Steve Arnold]
- Building lib and test programs works; custom test runner tweaks still
  needed. [Steve Arnold]
- Working libtool shared library build (no tests yet, so still a WIP)
  [Steve Arnold]

  Still not sure if that's what we want...
- Not quite working - WIP. [Steve Arnold]
- Make new autotools baseline, move to subdirs, add Makefile.am and
  configure.ac, populate initial GPL files. [Steve Arnold]


v0.0.0 (2017-03-10)
-------------------
- Fix build against current json-c paths and names. [Steve Arnold]
- Still filling holes in README doc. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]
- Another README formatting tweakage. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]
- README formatting fixes. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]
- Putting documentation README. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]

  Still a work in progress, some sections missing...
- Connect to unix socket instead of localhost tcp. [Stephanie Lockwood-
  Childs]

  Unix sockets are better for performance (and security, since permissions
  can constrain what clients use the socket) than localhost tcp
  connections, so a hard-coded path of /tmp/redis-ipc/socket replaces the old
  localhost & port in the category of things-that-probably-belong-in-a-config
- Provide sample output file for each test prog. [Stephanie Lockwood-
  Childs]
- Fix crashes after failing to connect to redis server. [Stephanie
  Lockwood-Childs]
- Support 'make testprogs' [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]
- Test program cleanup. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]

  test.c was a dupe, json_test can now be built from Makefile
- Native build should be default. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]

  When cross-compiling, set CROSS_COMPILE and SYSROOT. Skip setting
  them for native compiles.
- Just a couple more debug messages. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]

  Helped with debugging an app crash when a field was missing from redis
- Added GNU hash to linker args. [Stephen Arnold]
- Update makefile and added missing includes to test source files.
  [Stephen Arnold]
- Switched to thread-local storage. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]

  Discovered that arm compiler should support __thread variables, so was
  able to switch per-thread struct to thread-local without having to roll
  my own via different entries in a list.

  Multi-thread test program which would segfault about 1 in 3 times (due to the
  threads stomping on each other) now succeeded 100 times in a row.
- Make header C++ safe. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]

  use ifdef's to insert 'extern C' block in header when compiled under C++
- Added wrapper class for json-c access from C++ [Stephanie Lockwood-
  Childs]

  json-c brings with it the typical reference-tracking pain of
  dynamically allocated C objects, but redis_ipc uses it anyway
  to provide C compatibility. This wrapper class is intended
  to make use of a returned json_object * much less painful for
  applications that are written in C++ instead.
- Fix segfault after redis connection error. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]
- Fix single-field read of settings/status hashes. [Stephanie Lockwood-
  Childs]

  Return value was pointing to stuff that was going out of scope, so
  needed to stdup() a copy. Made note in the .h that, as usual, caller
  is responsible for cleanup when done with returned value.
- Add targets for test programs and install. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]
- Implemented single-field hash operations. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]

  Single-field versions of setting and status hash operations
  seem to be working now.
- Setting hash read/write implemented. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]

  Successfully performed setting write and read back with test
  program. Currently library is looking for component "db" as
  the one privileged to update settings, but that probably isn't
  the right name.

  Still need to implement single-field operations for both status
  and setting hashes.
- Status hash read/write implemented. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]

  Successfully performed status write and read back with test program.

  While adding hash support, discovered that redis syntax errors do not
  result in NULL replies but rather REDIS_REPLY_ERROR type replies,
  so redis reply checking had to be reworked accordingly.
- Pairing of command and result. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]

  After sending a command, the submitter will now discard result entries
  that do not have a matching ID and keep looking for the one that belongs
  to the just-submitted command.
- Send command and receive result almost works. [Stephanie Lockwood-
  Childs]

  Command processing is close to finished: one process can queue a
  command, and another process can receive and send back a result.

  Still need to put in the check to see that a received reply matches
  the recently-sent command (compare the command id strings).
- Queueing commands. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]

  The first half of sending commands has been implemented and exercised
  with test program. The command is being properly formatted and pushed to
  a redis queue, but parsing the result still needs to be filled out.

  Also cleaned up internal func ipc_path() to be less redundant.
- Cleanup func. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]

  Implemented cleanup func, though will need to revisit both init and
  cleanup to make them work with multi-thread processes (switch to a
  list of per-thread structs for saving state, as noted in FIXMEs).
- Subscribers can listen on channels. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]

  Finished up initial cut at pub/sub API by implementing the blocking
  listener function. Caller is responsible for not trying to listen
  until one or more channels have been subscribed, though library
  could track subscriptions if that became a problem.

  Test program is now able to post messages from one process and
  receive them from another.
- Implement subscribe/unsubscribe. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]

  Implemented functions for subscribe/unsubscribe from event or debug
  channels. The correct redis commands appear to be sent by the test
  program, and further verification awaits implementation of receiving
  published events/debug messages.
- Implement sending of events. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]

  events can now be published on redis
- Added timestamps to debug. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]
- Debug channel is working. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]

  Haven't implemented timestamp field for debug messages yet,
  but other than that debug messages are working -- JSON message
  looks correct and gets sent to redis pub/sub channel.
- Implementing init and send-debug funcs. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]

  Init function seems to work, debug function is mostly there -- generates
  json text, but prints to stdout instead of really publishing to redis.
- Starting library implementation. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]

  Started implementing functions. Init and send-debug functions are mostly
  implemented and compile now (not run-tested yet)
- Initial design but not implementation. [Stephanie Lockwood-Childs]

  Library include file has proposed function signatures

  None of the functions have been implemented yet however
